                    <ol>
                        <li class="list">Roleplay and Removal from the Community
                            <ul>
                                <li>A working microphone is required to play on Element RP.</li>
                                <li>Character age must be a minimum of 18. This is enforced for several reasons and should be followed when roleplaying.</li>
                                <li>Ignorance and minor FailRP offenses may be overlooked, but shouldn’t happen in the first place. Actions such as dancing on non-existent stripper poles, jumping on Police Cars in full view of officers, etc., aren’t providing Solid Roleplay. Realistically, you aren’t going to jump on a Police Officer’s vehicle in life.</li>
                                <li>Using the same sort of behavior in certain roleplay situations can be punishable. I.e.: Immediately shooting at a convenience store at every robbery, continuously cop baiting, kidnapping and griefing a certain group.</li>
                                <li>Players found to be habitually resorting to violence (Robbing, Killing, Shooting) with little to no roleplay between scenes will face disciplinary action.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Random Deathmatch(RDM) and Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM)
                            <ul>
                                <li>RDM/VDM is not allowed. RDM is defined as killing a player with little to no interaction.</li>
                                <li>VDM is using a vehicle to injure/kill a player with no in character reason or initiation.
                                    <p>VDM can be avoided if the scene is roleplayed correctly.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Initiation is required to engage in combat with another player. When initiating, you must make the player aware of your intent, and who will be assisting you. To initiate you must be AT LEAST within shout voice range, and you must allow the other person to respond to your roleplay with words or actions. A player may not be engaged in a menu or animation for proper initiation to occur.</li>
                                <li>Using an out of character (OOC) reason or information to kill a player is not allowed. This will be considered metagaming.</li>
                                <li>If you forcefully engage with someone while driving, the audio initiation rule becomes invalid, meaning they can fire on you if they fear for their life. Take this into consideration before forcing someone off the road the next time you want to rob them.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Combat Logging
                            <ul>
                                <li>Combat logging is exiting your game in any fashion to avoid RP. Combat logging comes in many forms, but examples are listed below.
                                    <p>Exiting the server to avoid legal charges</p>
                                    <p>Exiting the server to avoid losing weapons via respawn/robbery</p>
                                    <p>Exiting the server after your respawn timer is up, but BEFORE respawning</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Going Out of Character
                            <ul>
                                <li>Never go out of character in the game unless you're told to by a City Official (Moderator/Admin+)</li>
                                <li>Do not use Out of Character Chat (OOC Chat) to attack people who have broken rules in situations. These issues should be filed in reports for admins to handle. If you feel the rule break wasn’t serious enough to require admin review</li>
                                <li>Remember that OOC chat should be used for technical or game support only. Do not use OOC to taunt, question, or gloat to another player</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Restricted Roleplay
                            <ul>
                                <a>Slurs</a>
                                <li>There will be no racism tolerated on the server whatsoever. This includes slang words that can be considered offensive to some.</li>
                                <li>Homophobic, racial, or gender offensive slurs of any kind can and likely will, result in a ban. These will not be tolerated here. Slurs against nationality are also not tolerated.</li>
                                <a>Mental Health Roleplay</a>
                                <li>Any kind of roleplay mimicking mental health illness issues will not be tolerated. This includes self-harm, suicide, and other mental health issues such as abuse/trauma.</li>
                                <a>Sexual RP</a>
                                <li>Any kind of sexual RP that is NOT consensual between both parties is PROHIBITED.</li>
                                <li>Rape RP and threats will NOT be TOLERATED and will result in immediate BAN</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Metagaming, Powergaming, and Stream Sniping
                            <ul>
                                <li>Powergaming is forcing roleplay on another player without giving him or her the option to dictate their own fate. In RP, both parties must be able to decide how their characters will respond to something.</li>
                                <li>MetaGaming is retrieving or/and mixing OOC information with IC information to put you or others at an advantage. Even if it does not put you at an advantage, mixing OOC with IC is considered Meta-Gaming. Only use information you received In-Character.</li>
                                <li>Stream sniping (using someone's live stream to find their location to interact in anyway) is considered metagaming and is punishable as such. Don't do it.</li>
                                <li>Transferring items between your own characters is also metagaming. This includes using middle men to achieve the same task.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Copbaiting
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cop baiting is CONTINUOUSLY attempting to get a cop’s attention to engage in a car chase/arrest, etc.
                                    <p>Doing donuts or continually speeding up and down a road just to get into a chase or circling around cops to get their attention, etc.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Fail RP
                            <ul>
                                <li>FailRP can be anything regarding an extremely unrealistic situation that is used in the game to gain an advantage. This rule is meant to be used with common sense. Would your character do this in real life? Does it match with your character’s storyline?
                                    <a>Examples of failRP would be:</a>
                                    <p>Storing and re-pulling your vehicle to circumvent the repair system</p>
                                    <p>Roleplaying your injuries incorrectly. I.e.: You were shot by a shotgun, but claim that you tripped over a bench</p>
                                    <p>Tweeting to people in cuffs, tweeting to police about crime, or selling weapons/illegal contraband over Twitter</p>
                                    <p>Fake hostages (using friends or approaching someone and asking them to be a hostage for a scenario)</p>
                                    <p>Returning to or approaching the scene of a crime for the sole reason of reviving your friends via LEO or EMS</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Group Limitations
                            <ul>
                                <li>Criminal activity will be limited to no more than 4 in a group. A group is considered any number of people who are actively involved with the scene, including lookouts. You cannot call for backup beyond the participating 4 people.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Wills
                            <ul>
                                <li>A will can be left in the event of your characters death. There are some restrictions, however:
                                    <p>Only properties, vehicles and money can be willed, not inventory items of any kind.</p>
                                    <p>Your will must be signed off on by a judge or lawyer PRIOR to your characters death.</p>
                                    <p>Money left can not be more than $250,000.</p>
                                    <p>Vehicles left can not be more than 4.</p>
                                    <p>Properties, vehicles, and Money must be left to one individual. The executor can do with the willed items as they see fit.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">New Life Rule
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you end up on your back, whether it be to combat, starving, etc., you then fall within the lines of the New Life Rule.
                                    <p>You are only aloud to remember events and information from 15 minutes before you entered the current scenario.</p>
                                    <p>The only exception to NLR is if someone else witnessed the interaction AND survived (either did not get downed, or was revived while on their side) and tells you what happened.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>After you start a new life, you must initiate a new scenario entirely in order to act on any information or memories you have.
                                    <p>This means you need to RP a new altercation before going out to "get revenge" or address your death with the person(s) involved.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Insertion
                            <ul>
                                <li>Insertion is when you place yourself, without any valid reason, in an ongoing scenario to which you have no actual connection to.
                                    <p>This is not allowed, and will interrupt the interactions other players are having. An exception to this would be a gang member calling other gang members for backup within the limits of Fail RP (ie. don't try to call or radio someone if you're already at gunpoint).</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>If you notice an ongoing scenario, you must allow the person(s) involved to exit that scenario before starting a new one with them.
                                    <p>This means if someone shoots and kills someone you know, don't "piggyback" off of that scenario in order to retaliate with little to no interaction on your part. This will be considered RDM. A better alternative would be to get the downed/dead person(s) to the hospital and fill them in on what you saw.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">Not Valuing Your Life
                            <ul>
                                <li>NVL is when you blatantly disregard the fact that your life is in danger. This includes any action or conduct that would imply that there is not a threat.
                                    <p>While someone might "talk shit" while a gun is pointed at them, this shouldn't be extreme. Saying "just kill me already" is very low quality when it comes to situations where the obvious intent of the aggressor is to instill fear.</p>
                                    <p>You don't need to go overboard and deafen someone with any fake crying, unless you feel your character would cry like a little bitch, but you do need to show some kind of change in your demeanor.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <a>(Hospitals, Police Stations, City Hall, Flea Market, etc.)</a>
                                <li>Safe zones are areas and locations where combative and certain criminal actions are PROHIBITED.</li>
